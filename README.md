## automated_data_import_system
Gui application for an automated import system and statistical analysis screening data
## About

The project aims to provide an automated solution for data import and management. When the application is launched, it opens a window where the user is prompted to enter their data for further usage. Once successfully logged into the system, the user is greeted with a well-structured and organized menu, designed to facilitate easy navigation and utilization of various system functions and features. The menu provides a rich set of functions displayed as menu items, allowing the user to quickly access the desired options and system functionalities.
The main functions available in the menu include: selection of the indicator to be calculated, inputting the indicator to be calculated, obtaining a report for a specific individual, importing data from an XLSX file into the database, 
retrieving a comprehensive report. For patients, the project also includes the capability of entering their data through a Google Form, which does not require registration in the system. The Google Form was implemented to ensure simplicity, convenience, and benefits for the patients.
